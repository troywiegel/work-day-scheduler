// add entry to calendar and it saves it to local storage
//label entries by time of day

//one part want to be able to type in box and click save so it goes to local storage
//two part each time the page is refreshed, entries need to be pulled from local storage and added to page
//three part change the class names in text areas based on what hour it is

// use textarea for entries
//one div per entry with a p tag, textarea and a button at the end

//style isn't super important but functionality is

// use bootstrap grid to setup? maybe get rid of css file or elements? make time and button take up a little amount of space and the text area big

// colors don't need to update in real time just when page is refreshed

// want one onclick to work for every saveBtn don't want a separate one for each
//use class names not ID for the onlick part
// see office hours for tuesday on how to setup onclick
