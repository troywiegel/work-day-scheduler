# Work Day Scheduler

I created a Work Day Scheduler that:

* Displays the time, a textbox to enter details and a save button.
* The scheduler allows users to add content to the textbox and then save it to local storage in the web browser.
* Once information is stored, it remains on the page, even when the browser is refreshed. The color of the textbox changes from grey, green to orange for a past event, current event or future event.
